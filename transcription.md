# TypeScript
### Speaker Notes for presentation

Hi! My name is Vadim Mashnitsky and today I'm going to tell you about TypeScript.
And the first question is:

## What is TypeScript?
Well, TypeScript is a JS based programming language.
- It's a strict syntactical super set of JavaScript, which adds optional static typing to the language,which means, that you won't be able to dinamicly change types of variables, unless you want to.
- Any valid JS code is also valid if TS, so you don't have to lead a lot to use TypeScript, which makes it very convinient and easy to use for any JS developer
- TS compiles to plain JavaScript, which means you can run it anywhere, where JS can be run and even more, because TS can compile code with new JS features into older standarts of JS, such as ES-3

## What kind of languae is TS?
- Scripting
- Object-Oriented
- Structured
- Imperative
- Functional
- Generic

## Developer & Opensource licence
It was developes in MicroSoft as an open source project. TS was created by Anders Hejlsberg, the same man, who created Delphi and C#.
TS is a representation of his desire of bringin C# experience to JavaScript.


## How does it work
- compiles into plain JS
- helps to avoid mistakes

## What's the main advantage? Opitions
- Some comments i found

## What it's used for?

- Pretty much everything

## Conclusion
TypeScript is a cool, convinient language, which can make your development process much more efficient and help to avoid lots of silly mistakes
